# The grid is colored, each number is a color !
# Type a number and press ENTER to fill the right-up corner and all the same colored cells touching it.
# It'll only fill directly touching cells, not diagonal ones

# You have a limited amount of tries to fill up the grid with only one color ! 
# You have to use all of your tries
# The number of try, colors and the size of the grid can be changed in the C file.
